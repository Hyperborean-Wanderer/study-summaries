# AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner
**Cloud:** On-demand delivery of compute power, DB storage, apps and othe IT resources.
The access to the resources, as many as needed, is provided almost instantly. The exact
needed type and size of resources is charged just _pay-as-you-go_.

There's a simple way to access all these services, AWS does it via a Web App.There are
three types of Cloud models:
1. Private: Used by a single org, not exposed to the public. Provide security for
sensitive/specific applications.
2. Public: Resources owned and rented by a third-party. The service is delivered over
the internet.
3. Hybrid: Some physical servers are kept, some capabilities of the cloud are used. Can
still provide control on sensitive assets while providing cost-effectivenes of public.

There are five characteristics that are meant to be delivered:
1. On-demand and self-service, users can self-provide resources with no other human
interaction.
2. Broad access through network
3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling. Several customers share same physical
infrastructure, but with security and privacy.
4. Rapid elasticity and scalability. Automatic acquisition and disposal of resources as
needed.
5. Measured, users pay only for what they have used.

Six advantages:
1. Switch from Capital Expense (CAPEX) to Operational Expense (OPEX). Hardware belongs
to Cloud Provider, ownership and operational costs are reduced.
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.
3. Do not guess capacity, scale automatically.
4. Increase speed and agility.
5. Do not spend money on running/maintaining the data center.
6. Go global in minutes, using all AWS global infrastructure.

So in summary, Cloud computing offers a flexible, cost-effective, scalable, elastic,
highly-availble and agile environment for our application needs.

Types of Cloud Computing:
* IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service, the building blocks, parallel to tradicional
on-premises IT.
* Paas - Platform as a Service, no need to manage infrastructure, allows to focus on
deploying and managing our applications
* Saas - Software as a Service,
